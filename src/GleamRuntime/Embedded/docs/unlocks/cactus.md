# Cactus

Like other plants, [cacti](objects/cactus) can be grown on soil and harvested as usual.

```gleam
game.plant(game.Cactus)
```

However, they come in various sizes and have a strange sense of order.

If you harvest a fully-grown cactus and all neighboring cacti are in sorted order, it will also harvest all neighboring cacti recursively.

A cactus is considered to be in sorted order if all neighboring cacti to the `game.North` and `game.East` are fully grown and larger or equal in size and all neighboring cacti to the `game.South` and `game.West` are fully grown and smaller or equal in size.

The harvest will only spread if all adjacent cacti are fully grown and in sorted order.
This means that if a square of grown cacti is sorted by size and you harvest one cactus, it will harvest the entire square.

A fully grown cactus will appear brown if it is not sorted. Once sorted, it will turn green again.

You will receive cactus equal to the number of harvested cacti squared. So if you harvest `n` cacti simultaneously you will receive `n * n` `item.Cactus`.

The size of a cactus can be measured with `game.measure()`. It is always one of these numbers: `0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9`.

```gleam
case game.measure() {
  Some(game.MeasureValue(size)) -> size
  _ -> 0
}
```

You can also pass a direction into `game.measure_at()` to measure the neighboring tile in that direction of the drone.

You can swap a cactus with its neighbor in any direction using the `game.swap()` command.
`game.swap(game.North)` swaps the object under the drone with the object one tile in the `game.North` direction of the drone.

## Examples
In each of these grids, all the cacti are in sorted order and the harvest will spread over the entire field:

```gleam
3 4 5    3 3 3    1 2 3    1 5 9
2 3 4    2 2 2    1 2 3    1 3 8
1 2 3    1 1 1    1 2 3    1 3 4
```

In this grid, only the lower left cactus is in sorted order, which is not enough for it to spread:

```gleam
1 5 3
4 9 7
3 3 2
```

If the rows are already sorted, sorting the columns will not unsort the rows.

If you're not familiar with sorting algorithms, you might want to look them up online and think about which ones could be adapted to this problem. Keep in mind that not all of them work because you can only swap neighboring cacti.
